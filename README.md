# My Website Design

> Week 2 assignment for **My Website Design**

## Description

This is a single-person project by FSSE RevoU designed for us to make our Website Design,

Using both **_Miro_**[^1] and **_Figma_**[^2].

The focus of this project is to make **_Wireframe_**,

That will enable us to see **the layout of a web page** that demonstrates what interface elements **will exist** on key pages,

And to provide a **Visual Understanding** of a page early to ensure the terminology and structure used for the site meet user expectations.[^3]
